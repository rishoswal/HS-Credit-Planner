# hs-planner
### By: Rishabh Oswal

Across the US, high school students have gone through the tedious process of selecting courses and calculating credits. To solve this issue, I developed the High School Course Planner, a website filled with information from databases that calculates credits and warns the users for pre-requisites, too few or too many courses, and a plethora of other features.

The logic (coded in JS) and functionality of the website is fully functional. The database can be customized to a school's preference by forking the repository and modifying the database.

Initially created for the Congressional App Challenge 2022.
